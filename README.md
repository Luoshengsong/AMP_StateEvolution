# AMP_StateEvolution

Run plost_SE.m file.

we assume the signal is Bernouli-Gaussian, and the denoiser is thre related MMSE denoiser.

We implement the state evolution by numberical integration.

Specially, we characterize the state evolution as
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau^{(t)}_r = \frac{1}{\delta} \mathcal E^{(t)}
\end{aligned}
$$
